## Key Concepts

**So Long** improved my programming skills and logic as a novice in computer science and programming. This project was the first graphical project that I did during my school's program, it was also the biggest at the time.
The most interesting part for me was to create a floodfill algorythm to check the validity of the maps (floodfill). I also made the little sprites myself !

It was a nice project to make! üçå
